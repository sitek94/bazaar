I'm an experienced frontend developer expanding my skills into DevOps and backend development. I'm learning how to set up and manage services using containers and orchestration tools.

This project helps me learn how to connect different services using Docker Compose. I want to create a solid example that follows good practices for container setup, networking, and basic security.

The main goals are:
- Set up multiple services that work together
- Learn proper Docker configuration
- Follow production-like best practices (without extreme measures)
- Create a well-organized project structure

I want feedback on my Docker setup, container orchestration, security settings, and any other best practices I should follow. While this is for learning purposes, I want to implement a production-quality setup that would be suitable for real-world applications.

Notes on Best Practices:
- We want to follow solid, production-like best practices
- We don't need to go to extremes (e.g., using image digests instead of version pinning)
- The focus is on creating a learning environment that closely resembles production standards
